# VBA-Challenge
Sort through stocks using VBA to get yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume. Compare stocks to return the greatest percent increase, decrease, and total volume.
​
## Description
​VBA was used to look through data and gather yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume for each ticker throughout 3 different years. 
Print the information for each ticker once, then use the new information to obtain the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and the greatest total volume. 
The goal is to get through all worksheets with the VBA script to avoid repetitive tasks.
